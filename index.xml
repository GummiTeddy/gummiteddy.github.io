      <title>Battery-Less Sensing of Body Movements Through Differential Backscattered RFID Signals</title>
      <link>https://gummiteddy.github.io/publications/joun1/</link>

      <description>RFID tags not only can be used as identification devices, with antenna sensing techniques, they can also be used as low-cost and battery-less sensors. However, RFID antenna sensing relies on the impedance and/or gain modulation of the tag’s antenna, and extracts the sensing information through the RSSI variation of the backscattered signals. The sensing information is prone to the interferences and noises in the reader-tag communication channel, as well as the distance variations if the sensors are in constant motion.</description>

      <title>E-Textile Battery-Less Displacement and Strain Sensor for Human Activities Tracking</title>
      <link>https://gummiteddy.github.io/publications/joun2/</link>

      <description>Wearable sensors demand flexible and concealable devices that can be seamlessly integrated with apparels and clothes. E-textile sensors and devices, built from specially functionalized fibers and yarns and constructed with embroidery and woven processes, provide an ideal solution for different wearable applications. In this article, we propose a textile-based, embroidered passive strain and displacement sensor functioned as a UHF RFID antenna that can be aesthetically integrated with garment fabrics. The antenna structure consists of a dipole arm and a coupling loop mounted with an RFID chip.</description>

      <title>Wearable Deformation Sensor with Ambient Interference Rejection Using Differential Backscattered RFID Signals</title>
      <link>https://gummiteddy.github.io/publications/conf1/</link>

      <description>RFID technology not only enables wireless identification, it also provides the platform for battery-less antenna sensing capabilities, i.e., the sensing information is modulated by the antenna impedance, and it can later be extracted from the backscattered signals by the readers. However, antenna sensing is prone to interference and ambient environment impacts, such as distance variation and noise in the transmission path. These factors can cause amplitude and phase changes of the received signals, and deteriorate the quality of the sensing information.</description>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;JSON&amp;#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
